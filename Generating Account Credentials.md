# Generating Account Credentials with Bitwarden

**This guide assumes you have the [Bitwarden browser extension](https://bitwarden.com/download/) installed.**

Every other website you visit is asking you to create a new account, and all these new accounts require usernames and
passwords. This can be taxing to remember, and can wear down even the most robust pen or pencil. But fear not! With
Bitwarden, generating and saving new account information is simple.

1. **Access the Bitwarden Browser Extension:** Click the Bitwarden browser extension icon, usually found in your
   bookmarks
   bar or near the upper-right corner of your browser window. If you don't see it, click the puzzle icon (left of the
   Bitwarden icon in the image below) and select the Bitwarden icon from the menu. ![image](assets/icon%20location.png)
2. **Add a Login:** In the newly opened menu, click `Add a Login`. ![image](assets/add%20login.png)
3. **Generate a Password:** On the far-right of the password field,
   click `Generate Password`. ![image](assets/generate%20password.png)
4. **Enable Symbols:** Enable the symbols option. Most websites require symbols in your password. This option includes
   them automatically. ![image](assets/symbols%20option%20enabled.png)
5. **Customize Password Length:** Adjust the password length as needed. Typically, a length between 12 and 20 characters
   is accepted, but some websites may have specific requirements. ![image](assets/length%20option.png)
6. **Select the Generated Password:** Click the `Select` button in the upper-right
   corner. ![image](assets/select%20generated%20password.png)
7. **Save the Login Item:** Click the `Save` button in the upper-right corner. ![image](assets/save%20item.png)
8. **AutoFill Your Login:** Click your newly created login item. ![image](assets/autofill%20login.png)

### You're all set!

Any time in the future this website asks for your password, simply open the Bitwarden browser extension (Step 1) and
click the login item (Step 8).

## Pro Tip: Keyboard Shortcut

Instead of opening the Bitwarden browser extension and clicking the login item to autofill your password, press
`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`L` on your keyboard!
