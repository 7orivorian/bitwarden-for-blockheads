# Generating Account Credentials with Bitwarden

Every other website you visit is asking you to create a new account, and all these new accounts require usernames and
passwords. This can be taxing to remember, and can wear down even the most robust pen or pencil. But fear not! With
Bitwarden, generating and saving new account information is simple.

**This guide assumes you have the [Bitwarden browser extension]() installed.**

1. Click the Bitwarden browser extension icon. This icon will likely be located somewhere along the bookmarks bar, or
   near the upper-right corner of your browser window. ![image](assets/icon%20location.png)
    1. If the Bitwarden browser extension icon is not present, click the puzzle icon--left of the Bitwarden icon in the
       image above. The Bitwarden icon should visible in the subsequent menu. (You may need to scroll down to find it.)
2. In the newly opened menu, click `Add a Login`. ![image](assets/add%20login.png)
3. On the far-right of the password field, click `Generate Password`. ![image](assets/generate%20password.png)
4. Enable the symbols option. Most websites require symbols in your password. This option includes them
   automatically. ![image](assets/symbols%20option%20enabled.png)
5. Customize the length of the password. Some sites limit the minimum or maximum length of your password, so between 12
   and 20 is a safe option. ![image](assets/length%20option.png)
6. Click the `Select` button in the upper-right corner. ![image](assets/select%20generated%20password.png)
7. Click the `Save` button in the upper-right corner. ![image](assets/save%20item.png)
8. Click your newly created login item. ![image](assets/autofill%20login.png)

### You're all set!

Any time this website asks for your password, simply open the Bitwarden browser extension (Step 1) and click the login
item (Step 8).

## Fancy Shortcut

Instead of opening the Bitwarden browser extension and clicking the login item to autofill your password, press
`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`L` on your keyboard instead!
